Security shouldn’t be an afterthought. As Odoo adoption scales, gaps between rapid development and rock-solid protection only widen. **Odevmo** exists to close that gap—by equipping developers and administrators with tools they actually need.

## Our Modules

- [**Odoo Security Audit AI**](https://apps.odoo.com/apps/modules/18.0/security_audit_ai) (v16, v17, v18)  
  A premium static analysis tool with AI-generated insights, customizable detection rules, and export to PDF/CSV.

- [**Odoo Security Scanner Suite**](https://apps.odoo.com/apps/modules/18.0/security_scanner_suite) (v17, v18)  
  A free diagnostic pack for enforcing HTTPS, checking master password hygiene, auditing ACLs, and validating security settings.

- **Odoo API Security Scanner [Coming soon]** (v18)  
  Targets insecure API patterns in custom modules with rule-based static analysis for public routes, CSRF gaps, and more.

## Why Odevmo

- **Deep Odoo expertise:** Years inside the codebase—knowing not just how it works, but how it can fail.  
- **Actionable insights:** From live exploit demos to LLM-driven remediation tips (Gemini & OpenAI compatible).  
- **Developer-first design:** One-click scans in the backend, clear results, and modular APIs you can extend.
